I've been reading about Rust compilation stages, and wrote about some of my learnings in a [previous post](https://blog.shrirambalaji.com/posts/resolving-rust-symbols/). As I started reading more, I realized that it might be helpful to find a way to contribute to the project, learn more about the compiler and validate my assumptions / understanding of the compiler.

## Finding an issue to work on

The `rustc` compiler is a large codebase, and I was a bit intimidated by the size of the codebase. I started looking at the issues that were tagged as `E-mentor` and found an issue that was tagged as `E-mentor` and `E-easy` and landed on https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/129599.

It involved adding a new `std_features` flag to the bootstrap phase of the compiler, that helps in enabling `std` features for compiler development. This could be features like enabling `panic-unwind` or `backtrace` features when building the compiler.

This felt like a good issue to start with, and it was relatively straightforward to understand the issue, but I had to understand how the compiler was bootstrapped and how the `std_features` flag was passed to the compiler.

I also connected with [`Onur Ozkan`](https://onurozkan.dev) who was the mentor for the issue on zulip chat, and he was very helpful and welcoming throughout the process. Thanks Onur!

## What's bootstrapping?

Bootstrapping is how the compiler compiles itself, typically by using an older version to build a newer version. For rust to bootstrap, it has 4 stages:

- Stage 0: Pre-compiled Compiler
  This is the current beta `rustc` and is downloaded from the internet.
- Stage 1: Compiler built with the pre-compiled compiler from Stage 0
- Stage 2: Rebuilding the stage 1 compiler with itself, and this is what get's distributed with `rustup`.
- Stage 3 (optional): We can build libs with this compiler to sanity check that the compiler result is the same as the stage 2 compiler.

The [Rustc Dev Guide on Bootstrapping](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/building/bootstrapping/what-bootstrapping-does.html) has a lot more details on bootstrapping, if you're interested in learning more.

## Getting started

I followed the steps in the [Quick Start](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/building/how-to-build-and-run.html#quick-start) guide on my macOs machine, and I ran into my first issue.


### Lesson: Don't install `binutils` via `brew`

The `./x.py setup` command failed with the following error:

```

It looked like the build failed because the dependencies couldn't be compiled. Initially I thought that I had some system dependencies missing, but later found out that it was because of conflicting system dependencies. Specifically, I had `binutils` installed via `brew` and I had `strip` in my path, which was conflicting with the `strip` that was being used by the compiler.

So I had to remove `binutils` from my path, and then the build was successful:

```shell
brew uninstall binutils
```

### What's that python script doing in my rust compiler?

Wait a minute - why's there a python script to build the compiler? ðŸ¤”

`x.py` a wrapper that calls into `bootstrap` which is a cross-platform build tool backed by `cargo` specifically for the rust project. `x.py` by itself doesn't do a lot more, other than checking for the python version and subsequently invoking the `bootstrap.py` script, which does the following:
- Parses the CLI arguments and passes it on the `bootstrap` tool, located at `src/bootstrap`.
- Downloads the rust toolchain, and makes sure that the necessary build tools `rustc`, `cargo` etc., are available.
- Runs the bootstrap build using `cargo` to compile the bootstrap tool. The CLI arguments from earlier are passed to the `bootstrap` tool.
- Finally, the `bootstrap` tool is run with the CLI arguments.

So when we call `./x <subcommand>`, it's actually invoking the `bootstrap` CLI with the subcommand.

:::note
I understand the convenience of having a python script to wrap the build process, but it was a bit surprising to look at first. Also it does seem like Python is preferred for build scripts that run in CI, and it's not overused. There's a discussion to purge python, and over time it seems like a lot of the python scripts have been replaced. https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/110479
